### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060238
### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Algorithm:  1. Direct Instruction Prompts
Objective: Guide the chatbot to respond concisely to customer inquiries.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer asks for the status of their order, reply with: 'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'"
2. Contextual Prompting
Objective: Incorporate specific context to provide detailed answers based on the user‚Äôs previous interaction.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "If the customer previously mentioned that they haven‚Äôt received their order, say, 'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you and get back shortly.'"
3. Persona-Based Prompting
Objective: Design the chatbot to adopt a specific persona, making the interaction more engaging.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Pretend you are a friendly, helpful customer service representative. Use a conversational tone, such as 'Hey there! I‚Äôm here to help with any questions you might have. Let‚Äôs get your issue sorted!'"
4. Few-Shot Prompting
Objective: Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, enabling it to generalize for similar situations.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Here are some examples of how to handle technical questions:
'My phone isn't charging.' ‚Üí 'Have you tried using a different cable? If that doesn‚Äôt work, it may be an issue with the port.'
'The screen is flickering.' ‚Üí 'It sounds like a display issue. Have you tried restarting the device?'
Now, respond to: 'My app keeps crashing.'"
5. Chain of Thought Prompting
Objective: Use a step-by-step reasoning approach for resolving more complex or technical issues.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer reports their laptop overheating, guide them through the following steps:
Ask if they are using the laptop on a soft surface.
Suggest moving the laptop to a flat, hard surface for better airflow.
Ask if they‚Äôve cleaned the vents recently.
Recommend restarting the device to see if the issue persists.
Now, solve: 'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'"
6. Instruction with Constraints
Objective: Instruct the chatbot to provide assistance while adhering to specific constraints (e.g., response length or tone).
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "Respond to order inquiries in no more than 50 words and avoid using technical jargon. For example, 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date]. Feel free to reach out if you need anything else.'"
7. Reflective Prompting
Objective: Ensure that the chatbot reflects the user‚Äôs query back to them before providing a response, reducing misunderstandings.
Prompt Pattern:
Prompt: "When a customer asks for help, first reflect their question back to them. For example, if they ask 'How can I reset my password?' respond with 'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here‚Äôs how you can do it.'"
Result: The various types of Prompts are executed successfully.

## Prompt:
Write about how a runner feels before, during, and after running a marathon.

## Chatgpt said:
üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Before the Marathon
The runner feels excited but nervous. The heart beats faster, and there‚Äôs a mix of fear and hope. They wonder if they trained enough, but the crowd and energy give confidence.

üèÉ During the Marathon
At first, the runner feels strong and full of energy. As the miles go on, the body starts to tire. Legs feel heavy, breathing gets harder, and the mind wants to stop. But cheers from people and inner determination push them forward. Every step becomes a fight, but also a victory.

üèÅ After the Marathon
Crossing the finish line brings relief and joy. The pain is real, but the happiness is greater. The runner feels proud, strong, and accomplished, knowing the hard work was worth it.

## Prompt:
Write about what goes through a player‚Äôs mind during a close chess match, from the opening move to the final checkmate.

## Chatgpt said:
‚ôüÔ∏è Opening Moves
The player sits with focus. Thoughts race: ‚ÄúWhich opening should I use? How will my opponent respond?‚Äù Each move feels like planting seeds for the future. Confidence mixes with curiosity.

‚ôüÔ∏è Middle Game
The board grows complex. The player‚Äôs mind jumps between attack and defense: ‚ÄúIf I move here, what will they do? Is there a hidden trap?‚Äù Pressure builds, but so does excitement. Every piece feels alive, waiting for the right moment.

‚ôüÔ∏è Endgame
The board is quieter, but every move matters more. The player‚Äôs heart beats faster: ‚ÄúOne mistake can lose it all.‚Äù The brain pushes through fatigue, searching for the perfect plan. When checkmate finally arrives‚Äîwin or lose‚Äîthe mind floods with relief. Victory brings pride, defeat brings lessons, but both bring respect for the game.

# Result: Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully .
